# Project I: Linear Systems and Tridiagonal Matrices

This project explores the central role of linear systems in computational physics and numerical methods. After discretization of continuous models (ODEs/PDEs), problems often reduce to solving large linear systems with special structure.

## Goals

- Understand mathematical framework of linear systems and conditioning
- Study tridiagonal matrices from 1D discrete models
- Develop and analyze the Thomas algorithm (tridiagonal solver)
- Compare performance with general-purpose methods
- Apply to simple computational physics examples
